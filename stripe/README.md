# Ecommerce Project created with React, Bootstrap and Stripe Integration

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I wanted to build a project with Bootstrap as I had never used it before and wanted to learn it.

I also wanted to learn how to integrate some form of payment process so I decided to implement Stripe and learned how it can be used within a project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
